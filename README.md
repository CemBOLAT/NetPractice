# NetPractice (Networking Project)

This file provides a brief overview of networking fundamentals, including information on switches, routers, IP addresses, subnet masks, and more. It also contains questions from 1 to 10, each with its solution presented in image format.

## What is a Switch?

A switch is a device that facilitates communication between devices on a network. By inspecting Ethernet frames, it directs packets to the correct destination.

## What is a Router?

A router is a device that enables data transmission between different networks. It uses IP addresses for routing and ensures data transmission between different networks.

## What is an IP Address?

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier for a device on a network. There are two main types: IPv4 and IPv6.

## What is a Subnet Mask?

A subnet mask is a series of numbers used to distinguish between the network and subnetworks for an IP address. For example, a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0` designates the last 8 bits as the host portion.
